        <p id="content3">
            My name is Caden Cochran and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in IT while enjoying some of my
            favorite activities like fishing, snowboarding, and swimming. Fishing is a big part of my life and it is
            genuinely hard to find a photo of me that is not featuring me either holding a fish or trying to catch one.
            Whether I'm on the slopes, in the water, or working toward my career goals, I love staying active and
            working toward my future.

            During my time at Ash Grove High School, I participated in basketball, baseball, and football while
            maintaining a GPA above 3.5 and eventually receiving cum laude honors at my graduation. I also participated
            in the A+ program, maintaining all the requirements to receive the scholarship. I am now attending OTC
            using my A+ scholarship to hopefully obtain an Associate of Science in Information Technology.

            I have a deep love for fishing; something about it just captivates me and I never seem to get enough. While
            I also enjoy snowboarding and rock climbing, I don't get to do them as often since they can be quite
            expensive. Swimming is another favorite pastime of mine, which is probably tied to my passion for fishing.

            A major goal of mine is to graduate from college without obtaining a significant amount of debt. I want to
            achieve this by using scholarships and working when I can. I am also determined to pursue a career in
            Information Technology. If I can land a job in this field, I hope to create a stable career for myself to
            one day become a homeowner. Additionally, I am working towards purchasing my dream car, a Subaru WRX. I
            also hope to travel and experience different places outside of the US.
